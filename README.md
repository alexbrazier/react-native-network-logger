startNetworkLogging({ maxRequests: 500 });
```

```tsx
import NetworkLogger from 'react-native-network-logger';

const MyScreen = () => <NetworkLogger sort="asc" />;
```

#### Integrate with existing navigation

```tsx
import NetworkLogger, { getBackHandler } from 'react-native-network-logger';

const onBack = getBackHandler(navigate.onBack);

const MyScreen = () => (
  <Screen onBackPressed={onBack}>
    <NetworkLogger />
  </Screen>
);
```
